## Overview

This is a single webpage of a QR-code, comprisng of a head tag, body tag, main tag, paragraph with a few words, footer and CSS properties to make it sensible to whoever is viewing it.

This is my first project as a Web Development learner. And I will continue to work on more.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

```CSS
- @font-face {
  font-family: Outfit;
  src: url(https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit);
}
I find this property really helpful, makes it possible to use any desired font-family on the webpage.

- border-radius: 00px;
I didnt quite get this the first time used it but i've commit it to memory.

 ### Continued development

I will continue refining my knowledge in CSS and also try to learn to use SCSS sometime. 

My code is complicated with lots of classes for a single webpage. How can I minimize the number of classes and div to make my code easy to go through and light in the case of bigger projects?

During the testing process, I figured this webpage does not display the image on Firefox and Opera, please any suggestions on how to fix that issue?.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This platform helped while trying to link the 'font-family(url)' with my css file and it was really handy when I got confused on how to go about with the 'border-radius' and 'padding' for the image and paragraphs. I really like the ideas I got and will continue to use it going forward.
